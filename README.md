# University projects
Computer technologies department, ITMO University, 2014-now.

### 2 term
- [C++](https://github.com/artemohanjanyan/university/tree/master/2_term/languages). Big initeger arithmetics library and custom `std::list<std::string>` implementation from exam.
- [Programming paradigms](https://github.com/artemohanjanyan/university/tree/master/2_term/paradigms). Implementation of arithmetic expression parsing and evaluation in Java, JavaScript and Clojure using different programming paradigms.

### 3 term
- [Mathematical logic](https://github.com/artemohanjanyan/university/tree/master/3_term/logic). Formal proof validators, deduction theorem, proof generator for tautologies and generator of a+b proof in formal arithmetics implemented in Haskell.
- [C++](https://github.com/artemohanjanyan/university/tree/master/3_term/languages). Custom implementation of `optional` and proxy server, written in modern C++. Latter includes low-level RAII wrappers for Linux networking interface for C, asynchronous I/O API backed by epoll, basic incremental HTTP request parser, multithreaded DNS-resolver for lower latency and colorful log.
- [Android course project](https://github.com/artemohanjanyan/bluetooth-chess). Android application for playing chess via bluetooth.

### 4 term
- Type Theory couse. [Type inference](https://github.com/artemohanjanyan/university/tree/master/4_term/types/hw) for simply typed lambda calculus and [course notes](https://github.com/artemohanjanyan/tt-conspect) in LaTeX (in Russian) worth many sleepless nights spent on them.
- [Repository for Operating Systems course](https://github.com/artemohanjanyan/os) starring rshd server in (almost) pure C.
- [Java technologies](https://github.com/artemohanjanyan/university/tree/master/4_term/java). Deeper Java course with homeworks covering different parts of Java API, including concurrency and reflection API.

### 5 term
- [Computational geometry](https://github.com/artemohanjanyan/university/tree/distr/5_term/geom). Working with Delaunay triangulation in C++.
- [Multithreading](https://github.com/artemohanjanyan/university/tree/distr/5_term/geom). Blocking and non-blocking bank implementations.

### 6 term
- [Distributed systems](https://github.com/artemohanjanyan/university/tree/distr/6_term/distr). Implemented in Haskell.
