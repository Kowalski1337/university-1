# Type Theory

Normalization of lambda terms in normal order,
unification algorithm, and
type inference of terms in simply typed lambda calculus and terms in Hindley-Milner type system.

All implemented in Haskell programming language,
whose lazy evaluation helps to speed up those algorithms in some cases.
